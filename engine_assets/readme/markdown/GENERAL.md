# Engine Interface
![interface](../images/interface.png)
The engine GUI is divided into 5 sections:
- Left viewport: editor menus and project settings
- Top viewport: project management & game preview management
- Right viewport: controls & scene editor properties
- Bottom viewport: statistics & logging console
- Mid viewport: 3D display screen

# Folder Structures
The engine root directory holds 6 folders and 1 file:
- `binaries\`: holds the **.exe file** and library DLLs (do **NOT** touch).
- `engine_assets\`: holds all **engine resources** (do **NOT** touch).
- `game_assets\`:  holds all your **game resources**.
- `projects\`: holds all of your **projects** (do **NOT** touch).
- `config.fe3d`: technical configuration for game exporting.

# Development Order
- **Project management**
  > In the top-viewport you can create, edit, save and delete projects. 1 project = 1 game.
- **Environment editor**
  > This is where you can create environment entities. There are 3 types of environments: sky, terrain, water.
- **Model editor**
  > This is where you can create model entities composed of a mesh, textures, AABBs and other properties.
- **Animation editor**
  > This is where you can create custom animations using keyframe. Types of animation: translation, rotation, scaling.
- **Billboard editor**
  > This is where you can create billboard entities composed of texture/color/text and other properties.
- **Audio editor**
  > This is where you can create audio entities composed of an audio file.
- **Scene editor**
  > This is where you bring all the created environment, models, animations, billboards and audio together into a scene.
- **Script editor**
  > This is where you define your game logic. There are 3 types of logic: initialization, update, destruction.
- **Project settings**
  > This is where you can setup mostly graphical properties of your game such as shadow quality, reflection quality, etc.

# Project Management
- You can **create/edit/save/delete** a project in the top viewport.
- 1 project = 1 game.
- Every **project** is a different **game** and must have a **unique** name.
- A project has its own folder in the engine `projects\` directory.
- An important note is to **NOT** change anything in this directory!

# Project Settings
- Every project/game has its own settings file.
- All settings will be saved in `projects\<your_project>\settings.fe3d`.
- FXAA (default: ON). **Range**: ON or OFF.
- Shadow quality (default: 2048). **Range**: 512 to 8192.
- Reflection quality (default: 256). **Range**: 128 to 2048.
- Refraction quality (default: 256). **Range**: 128 to 2048.
- Max audio channels (default: 128). **Range**: 32 to 512.
