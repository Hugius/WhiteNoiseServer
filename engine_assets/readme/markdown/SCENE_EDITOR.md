### General
- All scenes will be saved in `projects\<your_project>\scenes\editor\`.
- **Everything** that you **place** in a scene (environment, model, billboard, sound, light) is **connected** to the **editors**. Only the things you change in the scene editor will be saved into the scene. For example: if you have a scene full of **green trees** and you change the color of that model to **red** in the **model editor**, those trees in the scene will become **red as well**.
